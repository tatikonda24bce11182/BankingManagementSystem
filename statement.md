# Problem Statement

## Background
Traditional banking operations require efficient digital systems to manage customer accounts, process transactions securely, and maintain accurate financial records.

## Problem
There is a need for a simplified banking management system that can:
- Handle multiple user accounts with different account types

- Maintain comprehensive transaction history
- Provide secure authentication mechanisms
- Generate detailed reports and account statements

## Proposed Solution
A Java-based Banking Management System that provides:
1. **Account Management Module** - Create, update, and manage customer accounts
2. **Transaction Processing Module** - Handle deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers
3. **Reporting Module** - Generate account statements and transaction histories
4. **Authentication Module** - Secure login system for customers
5. **Database Integration** - Persistent storage using MySQL

## Target Users
- Bank customers who need to perform basic banking operations
- Bank administrators who manage customer accounts
- System operators who maintain the banking system

## Scope

### In Scope:
- Account creation (Savings and Current accounts)
- CRUD operations on accounts
- Transaction processing with balance validation
- Transaction history tracking
- User authentication and authorization
- Report generation

### Out of Scope:
- Online/web-based banking interface
- Mobile banking application
- Loan management
- Credit card operations
- ATM integration
- Inter-bank transfers

## Expected Outcomes
A fully functional console-based banking system demonstrating:
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Database connectivity using JDBC
- Exception handling and input validation
- Multi-user support with role-based access
